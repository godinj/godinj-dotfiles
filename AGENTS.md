# Agent Guidelines

## Sesh session names

Session names in `sesh/sessions/*.toml` and `machines/*/sesh/sessions/*.toml` begin with a Nerd Font icon (e.g. ` `, `󱘖 `, `󰰸 `). Always preserve these icons exactly as they appear. Never strip, replace, or omit them when editing or generating session entries.
